1)Java components are JRE,JDK AND JVM .
JRE = java runtime environment,
JDK = java development kit.
JVM = java vertual machine,
  
inside the jdk 
jdk = jre + development Tools like (compiler,debuger, and dava docs Etc...)
        
inside the jre it has jvm + some java libreries
		
JVM tasks:
loads the byte code
varifies the byte code
and finelly it will exicute the code.
=======================================================================================================

2)j ava features
1.Object oriented programmimg.
2.platform indipendent
3.robust
4.multy threding
5.is has JVM

=======================================================================================================
3)Constructor
#constructor is special type of meyhod, which has sam name as class name
which is used to initialization on instance variables
   
type of constructors:
1.default constructors
-- java will genarate it   
2.constom constructors
-- developer will decler it 
and in constom constructor we have arguments to pass it , caled as argument constructors..
		  
=======================================================================================================		  
4)variavles - containers which is used to store the data or value

4 typs --
->  local variables or globle variables
->	static variables 
->	non-static variables or instance variables 
->  paramitarized variables 
=======================================================================================================
	
5) java is not puer object oriented programmimg language because it will supports primitive datatyps.


===========================================================================================================

7)OOPS (object oriented programmimng) oops basicaly stands for object oriented concepts,
to use the the properties of an objects by making use of some oop consepts as shown in below 
1.polimorphism
2.inheritance
3.encapsulation
4.abstraction
===========================================================================================================
8)class CountNo{

   publc static void main (String  [] args ){

      String str =  "sanket";
	  
	  char ch = ' ';
	  
	  for(int i=1; i<=str.)
	  
	  
   }	  
}

==========================================================================================================
11)Interface is a class which is use to connect two class 
and it will act as a bridge between those classes

Interface class is a 100% abstarct class 
it has abstarct methods
we can extract properties of any class by taking the rerence of Interface class by implimenting the class

in interface class multiple inheritance is supported.
==========================================================================================================
12)Exeption it is an event, which will happens in any step of the code dyring the exicution the code 
and the exeption is hadelled by 2 ways ===
1.compiler will handle 
2.develpoer will handle
    by using try and catch metbod
========================================================================================================

13)Access specifiers are are also called access modifiers and these are used with class properties like variables,
constoctors and methods ..

typs:
public,protected,private,default
========================================================================================================
14)Abstraction :
it is not complete abstarction because we can write costom or dummy methods in it 
and it will not supports multiple inheritance.
				  
				  
Interface : in interface it is complete abstraction process and it will not supports constom methods 
in here we can do multiple inheritance
========================================================================================================
15)class AddNum{

 public static void main(String [] args){
 
   
 
 }
